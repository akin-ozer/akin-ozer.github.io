                <p>Welcome to my introduction blog to Docker. No no no, it is a joke obviously. There are already
                    billions
                    of guides including mine at some deeps of Medium about Docker. I will try to get into theory of
                    Docker and containers, part that no one understands at first but less guides about.</p>

                <p>I am generally writing mid to high level posts. I am learning and want to share while dealing with
                    less and less documentation about new tech. This post being one of the exceptions but I'll try to
                    write about things less people interest in writing but more people actually needs. You can check out
                    other posts in this site, maybe you can find some interesting posts. Thanks for reading.</p>

                <h5 class="my-3">Virtual Machine Diagram</h5>
                <p>Virtual Machines are older but stable technology. <b>We still need them to abstract bare-metal
                    servers</b>.
                    Bare-metal server means normal server machine but powerful ones, in today's technology we generally
                    don't need that powerful machine but we need lets say 4 machines. We can divide those server
                    machines into smaller Virtual Machines and programmatically control lifecycle of those machines.
                    Buying
                    cost effective server machines is also more maintainable and more efficient from infra aspect.</p>

                <p>As seen in figure Virtual Machine technology is designed as just a new computer inside computer and
                    use <b>hypervisor</b> layer for kernel to kernel communication. This also imposes performance
                    backlash but
                    it is accepted and optimized. This also creates ultimate abstraction that containers don't have thus
                    VMs are more secure.</p>

                <p>Container technology emerged from similar needs why we needed Virtual Machines. We went monolithic
                    applications to microservices world. In this world <b>scaling, uptime, efficiency, ease of
                        deployments,
                        building applications in a reproducible manner gained importance</b>. Virtual Machines still was
                    enough
                    at some extend but applications became smaller and microservice count increased. People had to
                    deploy different applications in same VM to be efficient and enforcing abstraction between apps
                    became harder and harder. Deployments became more and more complex and builds became entangled.</p>

                <p>Containers risen with Docker and went Open Source at March 2013. There was daemon back then that uses
                    LXC because Operating Systems didn't know about containers. Docker had to implement by themselves at
                    March 2014 named <b>libcontainer</b>. We will get into details later on but it had several great
                    ideas.
                    Docker became interesting technology and shaky, very basic technology arisen named "Kubernetes" at
                    June 2014. There were already great technologies about container orchestration like Docker Swarm,
                    Apache Mesosphere and even some bash scripts were better than this <b>Kubernetes</b>. At June
                    2015 <b>OCI(Open Container Initiative)</b> launched that will be run by <b>Linux Foundation</b> to
                    create
                    standards in container space. A month later <b>CNCF(Cloud Native Computing Foundation)</b> emerged
                    that
                    will also run by Linux Foundation with <b>Kubernetes and Google announced donataion of project to
                        CNCF</b>. Back to containers, <b>Docker donated libcontainer to OCI and renamed as "runc"</b>.
                    Linux started
                    supporting containers natively and here we are.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>As seen in this image containers run in container engine OR natively on Linux. Image shows native
                    version which should be used in production environments. There is no hypervisor, containers just run
                    like system processes. We will get in more details later.</p>

                <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Container Deep Dive</h3>
                <p>The <b>kernel</b> provides process isolation by creating separate <b>namespaces</b> for containers.
                    Namespaces
                    enable creating an abstraction of a particular global system resource and make it appear as a
                    separated instance to processes within a namespace. Consequently, several containers can use the
                    same resource simultaneously without creating a conflict. There are several types of
                    namespaces. </p>

            <ul class="mb-5">
                <li class="mb-2"><b>Mount namespaces</b> isolate the set of file system mount points seen by a group of
                    processes so that processes in different mount namespaces can have different views of the file
                    system hierarchy. With mount namespaces, the mount() and umount() system calls cease to operate on a
                    global set of mount points (visible to all processes) and instead perform operations that affect
                    just the mount namespace associated with the container process. For example, each container can have
                    its own /tmp or /var directory or even have an entirely different userspace.
                </li>
                <li class="mb-2"><b>UTS namespaces</b> isolate two system identifiers – nodename and domainname,
                    returned by
                    the uname() system call. This allows each container to have its own hostname and NIS domain name,
                    which is useful for initialization and configuration scripts based on these names. You can test this
                    isolation by executing the hostname command on the host system and a container – the results will
                    differ.
                </li>
                <li class="mb-2"><b>IPC namespaces</b> isolate certain interprocess communication (IPC) resources, such
                    as
                    System V IPC objects and POSIX message queues. This means that two containers can create shared
                    memory segments and semaphores with the same name, but are not able to interact with other
                    containers memory segments or shared memory.
                </li>
                <li class="mb-2"><b>PID namespaces</b> allow processes in different containers to have the same PID, so
                    each
                    container can have its own init (PID1) process that manages various system initialization tasks as
                    well as containers life cycle. Also, each container has its unique /proc directory. Note that from
                    within the container you can monitor only processes running inside this container. In other words,
                    the container is only aware of its native processes and can not "see" the processes running in
                    different parts of the system. On the other hand, the host operating system is aware of processes
                    running inside of the container, but assigns them different PID numbers. For example, run the ps -eZ
                    | grep systemd$ command on host to see all instances of systemd including those running inside of
                    containers.
                </li>
                <li class="mb-2"><b>Network namespaces</b> provide isolation of network controllers, system resources
                    associated with networking, firewall and routing tables. This allows container to use separate
                    virtual network stack, loopback device and process space. You can add virtual or real devices to the
                    container, assign them their own IP Addresses and even full iptables rules. You can view the
                    different network settings by executing the ip addr command on the host and inside the container.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h5 class="mt-5 mb-3">Popular container toolings</h5>
            <ul class="mb-5">
                <li class="mb-2"><b>Docker</b> a classic runtime. Should be default choice easily.
                </li>
                <li class="mb-2"><b>CRI-O</b> brings abstraction for <b>kata containers</b> and native usage, if you are
                    into kata containers it's fine. Brags about security by disabling root privileged containers and
                    being daemonless. Both can be achieved by containerd anyway and Kubernetes also abstracts this.
                </li>
                <li class="mb-2"><b>rktlet</b> once a big hit before containerd and Docker optimizations, now not that
                    much.
                </li>
                <li class="mb-2"><b>containerd</b> this piece of software is now almost Docker and Docker is almost
                    containerd. No performance loss or <b>heavy runtime</b>
                    contrary to what people think.
                </li>
                <li class="mb-2"><b>Podman</b> CRI-O's daemon(you shouldn't say that I guess).
                </li>
                <li class="mb-2"><b>Windows Containers</b> no one really cares but has to support. Unloved child, like
                    Windows itself.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h5 class="mt-5 mb-3">Container Lifecycle</h5>
            <p>I personally recommend you to check this thoroughly. It's far better than memorizing docker commands. If
                you know this, you also pick up docker commands easily.</p>
